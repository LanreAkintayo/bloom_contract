So, to create deals, I'm going to create a two tokens for example
1. USDC
2. DAI

So, in total, there will be 3 tokens that would be used to create Deals;
1. Native Token (ETH, BNB, S)
2. USDC
3. DAI


For the price feeds, I have to supply prices for each of them;
1. NATIVE TOKEN --> Check price online
2. USDC - $1 --> decimals = 8
3. DAI - $1  --> decimals = 18


Create a mock vrf for random numbers

**Disputes**
The token address that was used in creating deal will be used to open dispute


**Appeal**
The token address that was used in creating deal will be used to appeal


**Don't Forget**
Don't forget to lock staked amount of the jurors oo
Evidence should have an ID or something
